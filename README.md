# DATA-228-Group-Project - CateLytics

CateLytics: Review-Driven Categorization using
Amazon Data” is a Big Data project designed to categorize
Amazon products based on insights derived from user reviews.
The goal is to ascertain the trends around customer-centric
product categories based on customer reviews. By focusing on the
feelings and remarks of the users, it seeks to uncover the hidden
categories of products, that may not fall into the conventional
groupings, offering a more intuitive understanding of products
through the user reviews. Spark will be leveraged to perform the
majority of the data operations like Exploratory Data Analysis,
Data Preprocessing and also Data Transformations. Spark will
aid in working with and analyze huge amounts of unstructured
data; this, in turn, helps customers find a product that fits their
needs for highly regarded goods. More so, CateLytics wishes to
make customers’ choices easier, rather than relying on traditional
product descriptions or ratings, to an educated, moral purchase
based on actual user feedback and sentiment by using natural language 
queries through a Chatbot.
